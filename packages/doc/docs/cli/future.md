## Just brainstorming with ideas

Cli should become 3 different packages:

- `scripts` to be used by apps and microfrontends to build/start (`cmra start` and `cmra build`)
- `create` to create modules (`cmra create`)
- `cli` to access backofffice API (does not exist today)
- should `cmra publish` and `cmra deploy` be on cli or scripts?
