import { BetaTag } from './components/tag';

Our cli aims to help you creating, developing and shipping your project.

```bash
  npx @cmra/cli [command] <options>
```

Core features:

- `create` enables you creating an entire `app` or just some `microfrontend` or `library`;
- `build` wraps some build logic around `react-scripts`;
- `start` helps with development experience with tools like hot reload and previewing a microfrontend inside a webapp;
- `publish` <BetaTag /> integrates with supported platforms (eg: github).

```bash
  npx @cmra/cli --help
  npx @cmra/cli start --help
  npx @cmra/cli build --help
  npx @cmra/cli create --help
```
